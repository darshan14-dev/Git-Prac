//Merge

1)  ------> create a pull request
            -> and then merge using GitHub UI

2) -------> if you performed merge on your local device and then push to remote,
            it wont create a pr

3)--------> solving merge conflicts
           First, make sure you’re on your branch:  git checkout feature

           Then, fetch the latest commits from the remote: git fetch origin

           To integrate changes from main into your branch, either merge or rebase:
           Merge approach:  git merge origin/main


           If there are conflicts, edit the conflicted files,
           remove Git markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>), then:

           git add <file>
           git commit


           Rebase approach (cleaner history):   git rebase origin/main


           Resolve conflicts if they appear:
           git add <file>
           git rebase --continue


           After successfully integrating changes, push your branch:
           After merge:

           git push origin feature

           After rebase (history changed → force push):

           git push --force-with-lease

 main:    A --- B
 feature:       C --- D

                                 ---->       main:    A --- B -------- M
                                                              \       /
                                           feature:            C --- D

Git creates a new merge commit (unless it’s a fast-forward merge)
This merge commit has two parents:
   -the previous main commit
   -the last commit of the feature branch
So none of the old commits are lost.

//Rebase

keeps the commit history linear ,old commits are rewrote and replaces they are still
stored in "Ref-Log" for 30-90 days before cleanup you can retrive them back

main:     A --- B --- C
                           \
feature:                     D' --- E'
